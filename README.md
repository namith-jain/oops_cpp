### About the applications:
#### Basically it is Car Rental Service provider application built using CPP. This will provide user to request car by providing his/her basic information and rents the car according to their age and type of car they selected. After they can return the car by paying the rental amount and can exit by giving feedback.

  ### Future Work
  
  This project is mainly focused on Object Oriented Programming but this can be made into real world use case by adding a database. For this using relational database               management system to store the data in a structured and organized way is an efficent approach. SQL is used to perform DDL, DML. After populating or adding data to the database     this can be further used to fetch specific data from database and can be used for analysis, eg: Analyzing which type of car is most oftenly used by the customers, will help the   company to add more cars of specific type to generate more profits.
